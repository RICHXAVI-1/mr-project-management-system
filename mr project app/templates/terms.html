          <h2>1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        </div>
        <p>These Terms form a legally binding contract between you ("User", "Client", "Student", "Researcher") and
          <strong>Mr. Project</strong> ("Company", "we", "us"). By using the Services you confirm that you have read,
          understood and agree to these Terms. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time; changes will be
          effective when posted and your continued use of the Services will constitute acceptance of those changes.
        </p>

      <section id="scope">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Mr. Project provides professional support in the following areas (collectively, the "Services"):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Academic writing assistance (undergraduate, masters, and professional thesis/dissertation support)</li>
          <li>Data analysis and data visualization services</li>
          <li>Research consultation and methodological support</li>
          <li>Web development and related digital services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our Services are intended to provide guidance, instruction, and technical support. They are not a substitute
          for a client’s own original work and should be used in compliance with the academic policies and codes of
          conduct applicable to the client.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="eligibility">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>3. Eligibility and User Responsibilities</h2>
        </div>
        <p>By using our Services you represent and warrant that you meet the following requirements:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You are at least 18 years old, or have the consent of a parent or legal guardian to use the Services.</li>
          <li>You have legal capacity to enter into a binding contract.</li>
          <li>You will use the Services for lawful and permitted purposes only.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the Services to promote academic dishonesty, plagiarism, or fraud.</li>
          <li>Share, sell, distribute or republish deliverables without our prior written permission (subject to Clause
            5 below).</li>
          <li>Transmit malware, infringing material, or otherwise harmful content.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="orders">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>4. Orders, Payments and Refund Policy</h2>
        </div>
        <p>All service requests must be placed through our official channels (website order form, official email, or
          authorized representatives). Specific terms for high‑value projects may be set out in a separate contract.</p>
        <p><strong>Payments:</strong> Fees are payable as agreed at the time of engagement. For many services, payment
          in full or a deposit is required before work begins. We accept the payment methods displayed on our platform
          or communicated during quotation.</p>
        <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> Because our services typically involve bespoke work, fees are generally
          non‑refundable once work has commenced. In special circumstances—if the Company fails to deliver as
          agreed—partial or full refunds may be issued at the Company’s discretion following a review. Any refund policy
          in a separate written agreement will take precedence over this clause.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional costs:</strong> Revisions or extra features outside the original scope may incur
          additional fees. Clients are responsible for any third‑party costs (e.g., paid datasets, premium plugins)
          unless otherwise agreed.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="ip">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Company retains ownership of the intellectual property in materials,
          templates, tools, and methodologies used to produce deliverables. Ownership of the final deliverables produced
          specifically for the Client will be transferred to the Client upon the Company receiving full payment for the
          applicable services.</p>
        <p>The Company may retain copies of work for backup, training and quality control. Anonymized excerpts of
          deliverables may be used for the Company’s portfolio or marketing unless the Client provides prior written
          notice requesting non‑disclosure.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="integrity">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>6. Academic Integrity Disclaimer</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Mr. Project does not endorse or facilitate academic dishonesty. Our deliverables are provided as models,
          references, or technical support to help the Client learn and complete their own work. The Client is solely
          responsible for ensuring that any material submitted to an educational institution or employer complies with
          that institution’s rules and policies.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="delivery">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>7. Service Delivery and Revisions</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The Company will use reasonable efforts to deliver work by agreed deadlines. Delivery times are estimates and
          may change due to the complexity of the project or delays in receiving necessary information from the Client.
        </p>
        <p>One round of reasonable revisions may be included. Additional revisions or changes that materially alter the
          original brief will be treated as a new request and may incur further charges.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="privacy">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>8. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
        </div>
        <p>We collect personal data necessary to provide our Services (for example, name, contact details, academic
          details, and project materials). We process and store personal data in accordance with applicable data
          protection laws.</p>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with third‑party service providers only as
          required to deliver the Service (for example, payment processors) and always under contractual obligations to
          protect your data. More details are available in our Privacy Policy.</p>

          <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        </div>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company’s aggregate liability arising out of or related to these
          Terms or the Services shall not exceed the total fees paid by the Client for the specific Services that gave
          rise to the claim.</p>
        <p>Neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including
          lost profits, loss of data, or reputational damage, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

      <section id="indemnity">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The Client agrees to indemnify and hold the Company, its officers, employees and agents harmless from any
          claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from or
          connected to the Client’s breach of these Terms or misuse of the Services.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="termination">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>11. Termination of Services</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The Company may suspend or terminate Services and access to accounts if the Client breaches these Terms,
          engages in fraudulent or abusive behaviour, or threatens staff. If terminated for cause, outstanding fees for
          work completed shall become immediately due.</p>

          convenience only. The Company is not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or terms of those third
          parties.</p>

          the jurisdiction of the courts of Nigeria, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

          control, including natural disasters, strikes, acts of government, internet outages, and other force majeure
          events. Performance deadlines will be extended for the duration of such events.</p>
